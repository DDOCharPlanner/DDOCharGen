DESCRIPTION: {\b Paladins are supremely resilient and have a good balance of offense and defense. They protect
 and support allies better than the other melee classes, provide some healing, and wield the power of good 
 as a mighty weapon.}\par\par 
{\b {\cf5 Solo Ability}}: Very Good.\par\par
Through their devotion and purity, paladins gain many special abilities. They can deal extra damage to evil
 creatures, can boost their own {\b {\cf5 saves}}, and can use Lay on Hands to send powerful healing energy to allies.\par\par 
At level 4, paladins get their first helpful spells which they can use to aid themselves or their party.\par\par
Paladins also get immunities to harmful effects like disease and fear, and radiate powerful protective auras
 that help defend all nearby allies.\par\par
Important {\b {\cf5 stats}}:\par 
Strength and Charisma are the most important stats for paladins. Strength affects melee attack chance and
 damage, and high charisma makes many of a paladin's special abilities more powerful.\par\par 
A moderate level of wisdom is also needed for a paladin to cast spells.\par\par

CLASSNAME: Barbarian;
DESCRIPTION: {\b Barbarians possess incredible strength and offensive power. They are not
 as well armored as fighters, but they can absorb damage and go into a battle rage to
  overwhelm their enemies.}\par\par
{\b {\cf5 Solo Ability}}: Good.\par\par
Barbarians are the beasts of the battlefield. Often using huge two-handed weapons or
 two weapons at once, they can deal immense amounts of melee damage.\par\par 
By tapping into the raw fury of nature, barbarians can enter a battle rage that boosts
 their fighting ability to extreme levels, but they need to recover afterwards.\par\par 
Barbarians also have the ability to shrug off or absorb some incoming physical attacks
 without taking damage. This is called damage reduction (DR) and can help make up for
  their lack of heavy armor.\par\par
Important {\b {\cf5 stats}}:\par 
Strength is the most important stat for barbarians. High strength boosts a barbarian's
 ability to hit enemies and increases the damage dealt with each attack.\par\par 
Constitution is good for barbarians who want more {\b {\cf5 hit points}}, and dexterity is good for
 barbarians who want increased defense.\par\par

 without weapons and armor, they can assist allies or destroy enemies but take longer to master than
 the other melee classes.}\par\par 
{\b {\cf5 Solo Ability}}: Very Good.\par\par
Monks can study different philisophical paths to allow them to use a number of special moves in battle.\par\par 
Through intense physical training and mental discipline, monks gain the ability to generate and control
 ki. They use this vital energy to launch powerful combination attacks and project amazing beneficial
 effects.\par\par 
In order to use their special abilities, monks must be in a state of physical and mental balance called
 being centered. To remain centered, a monk cannot wear armor and must fight unarmed or with special
 monk weapons like staffs and kamas.\par\par
Important {\b {\cf5 stats}}:\par 
Strength and Wisdom are the most important stats for monks. Strength affects melee attack chance and

CLASSNAME: Rogue;
DESCRIPTION: {\b Rogues use stealth and a variety of masterful techniques to disarm traps, unlock doors,
 and take down enemies with devastating sneak attacks.}\par\par 
{\b {\cf5 Solo Ability}}: Challenging.\par\par
Stealthy and sly, rogues pride themselves on their skill. They are among the best at finding secret doors
 and traps and are the only class that can disarm traps. They can also pick locks to gain access to special
 areas and treasure chests.\par\par 
Rogues also have a powerful ability called the sneak attack. With proper skill and strategy, they can use
 this to devastating effect.\par\par 
Rogues make great scouts and are easily able to blend with the shadows and go undetected. Combining stealth
 with sneak attacking can be a powerful combination.\par\par
Important {\b {\cf5 stats}}:\par 
Dexterity is the most important stat for rogues. High dexterity boosts a rogue's defense and reflexes
 and improves key rogue skills like sneaking and trap disarming.\par\par 
Strength is important for rogues who want to increase attack power, and intelligence is important for
 rogues who want to maximize their skills.\par\par

CLASSNAME: Ranger;
DESCRIPTION: {\b Rangers are extremely versatile combatants. They can act as scouts, can
 wield two weapons at once, and are lethal with a bow.}\par\par 
{\b {\cf5 Solo Ability}}: Good.\par\par
Rangers switch between bow and melee combat, shooting until the enemy closes to melee
 range, then switching weapons. They are the best class at two-weapon fighting, using
 a weapon in each hand. In addition, they can make very good scouts, sneaking ahead of
 the party and gathering information on enemies.\par\par 
Rangers are also incredibly skilled with the bow. They can eventually learn remarkable
 techniques like shooting through groups of enemies with a single arrow or firing multiple
 arrows simultaneously.\par\par 
Rangers can also cast several useful spells and begin to learn these at level 4.\par\par
Important {\b {\cf5 stats}}:\par 
Strength and Dexterity are the most important stats for rangers. Strength affects melee
 attack chance and damage, and high dexterity boosts a ranger's defense and ability to
 hit enemies with a bow.\par\par 
A moderate level of wisdom is also needed for a ranger to cast spells.\par\par

 command. They excel at curing ailments and healing allies but also have the ability to blast
 enemies with their divine power.}\par\par 
{\b {\cf5 Solo Ability}}: Very Good.\par\par
Clerics use {\b {\cf5 divine}} magic and gain all of their spells as they level up. They don't have to inscribe
 new spells like wizards or pick a subset like favored souls. Clerics also have a special ability
 called Turning. They can use this to attack undead or assist allies.\par\par 
Unlike wizards and sorcerers, clerics have powerful healing spells and can wear armor and use
 shields, granting them better protection than other casters.\par\par 
When clerics are at taverns or rest shrines, they can switch to different spells to better address
 the challenges of their current quest. Favored souls and sorcerers cannot do this.\par\par
Important {\b {\cf5 stats}}:\par 
Wisdom is the most important stat for clerics. High wisdom makes a cleric's spells more difficult
 for enemies to resist and gives him or her more {\b {\cf5 spell points}}.\par\par

CLASSNAME: Sorcerer;
DESCRIPTION: {\b Sorcerers are born with the ability to use powerful magic. They have fewer spells
 than wizards but can cast much faster and more often.}\par\par
{\b {\cf5 Solo Ability}}: Challenging.\par\par
Sorcerers can innately cast {\b {\cf5 arcane}} spells without needing academic training like wizards. They
 can only perform a fixed number of spells in this way, but they can cast them much faster and
 can do more damage over time.\par\par 
Sorcerers, along with Favored Souls, get more {\b {\cf5 spell points}} than any of the other classes. They
 also gain more bonus spell points from special magic items. As a result, they can cast more often.\par\par
Sorcerers cannot switch spells at taverns or rest shrines. They are able to switch spells but to
 do so they must undergo a special ritual that can only be done once every few days.\par\par
Important {\b {\cf5 stats}}:\par 
Charisma is the most important stat for sorcerers. High charisma makes a sorcerer's spells more
 difficult for enemies to resist and also gives him or her more {\b {\cf5 spell points}}.\par\par 
Constitution is important for sorcerers who want to increase their {\b {\cf5 hit points}}, and dexterity is
 important for increasing defense.\par\par 
Typical abilities: {\b {\cf5 Empower Spell}}, {\b {\cf5 Maximize Spell}}.;

CLASSNAME: Artificer;
DESCRIPTION: {\b Combining magic with weapon technology and skill, artificers can attack their enemies in
 multiple ways, summon pets for support, and can also spot and disable traps.}\par\par 
{\b {\cf5 Solo Ability}}: Good.\par\par
Artificers use a mix of {\b {\cf5 arcane}} magic and technology to augment items and blast foes. Wielding
 rapid-fire crossbows and magical 'rune arms', they have a fighting style unlike any other class.\par \par
Having less {\b {\cf5 spell points}} than wizards and sorcerers, artificers must rely on their weapons more
 in battle. To achieve this, they learn how to use multiple types of crossbow and special rune arms, magic
 items that can charge up and shoot enemies with elemental bolts of energy.\par \par
They also have pets to aid them in battle that advance and grow with them and can be fitted with special
 equipment to improve their abilities.\par \par
Important {\b {\cf5 stats}}:\par 
Intelligence is the most important stat for artificers. High intelligence makes an artificer's
 spells more difficult for enemies to resist and gives him or her more {\b {\cf5 spell points}}.\par\par 
Constitution is important for artificers who want to increase their {\b {\cf5 hit points}}. Some artificers
 may focus more on melee weapons, and for them strength is important.\par \par
Notable abilities: {\b {\cf5 Inscribe Spell}}, {\b {\cf5 Unleash Iron Defender}}.;

CLASSNAME: Druid;
DESCRIPTION: {\b Powerful spell casters and shapechangers, druids have a large variety of divine spells and can
 change into various animal forms to change the role they play in a group.}\par\par
{\b {\cf5 Solo Ability}}: Good.\par\par
Druids use {\b {\cf5 divine}} magic and gain all of their spells as they level up. They don't have to inscribe
 new spells like wizards or pick a subset like favored souls. Druids also have the amazing ability to actually
 change form into animals and other natural creatures. They can use this to change the way they attack enemies.\par \par
Unlike wizards and sorcerers, druids have access to healing spells, but cannot heal as much as clerics or favored
 souls.\par \par
At taverns or rest shrines, druids can switch spells to better address the challenges of their current quest.\par \par
Druids also have pets to aid them in battle that advance and grow with them.\par \par
Important {\b {\cf5 stats}}:\par
Wisdom is the most important stat for druids. High wisdom makes a druid's spells more difficult for enemies to
 resist and gives him or her more {\b {\cf5 spell points}}.\par \par
Constitution is important for druids who want to increase their {\b {\cf5 hit points}}, and strength is important
 for increasing attack chance and damage output in animal form.\par \par

CLASSNAME: Warlock;
DESCRIPTION: {\b Warlocks make pacts with otherworldly beings to gain power and might. This relationship between warlock
 and patron is somewhat like that of a cleric and deity, but beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods.}\par\par 
{\b {\cf5 Solo Ability}}: Fair.\par\par
Warlocks summon powerful energies, attacking enemies with {\b {\cf5 Eldritch Blast}}.\par \par
Warlocks cast spells through their connection with their patron. They can only perform a smalls number of spells in this way,
 but that's supported by the ability to endlessly inflict magical damage with Eldritch Blasts.\par\par 
Warlocks cannot easily switch spells at taverns or rest shrines. They are able to switch spells but to do so they must undergo
 a special ritual that can only be done once every few days with the help of a Warlock trainer.\par\par
Important {\b {\cf5 stats}}:\par 
Charisma is the most important stat for Warlocks. High charisma makes Eldritch Blast and spells more difficult for enemies to
 resist and also gives more {\b {\cf5 spell points}}.\par\par
Constitution is important for Warlocks who want to increase their {\b {\cf5 hit points}}, and Intelligence is important for
 increasing skills.\par \par
