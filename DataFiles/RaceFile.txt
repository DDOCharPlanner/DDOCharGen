 there, when a world full of darkness, iniquity, and sorrow raged outside? No! You will not be deterred. You will bear
 Amaunator's holy light into the heart of the shadow.\par\par

RACENAME: Shadar-Kai;
DESCRIPTION: {\b I have broken my chains. The shadow will not catch me now.}\par\par
A lethal rogue who has thrown off the Netherease yoke and drawn on innate powers of the Shadowfell to hide and kill.\par\par
Since first memory, the thrill of the hunt was enough to make you feel truly alive. You did as your masters bid, and all was
 well. But then they bade you go outside the Shadowfell and this bright world has sewn confusion in your soul. Killing has lost
 its charm, and to not feel deeply is death to a Shadar-kai.\par\par
So on a desperate impulse, you ran. That felt good. Of course, the masters are after you now. But you'll live all right... if they
 don't kill you first.\par\par
(Iconics begin at level one and have fifteen level worth of XP. You may choose to keep to the path or change
 class as you see fit.);
